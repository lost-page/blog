## About Lost Page Blog

After 10 years of building software—both professionally and as a hobby—there are some insights I'd like to document. Some posts capture key learnings at specific moments in time. Others serve as a way to think out loud.

If you find yourself on this site, please consider anything you read an attempt to understand the technical world through writing. I may get things wrong or change my mind. I will update posts as needed when I discover errors or my perspective evolves. Everything here reflects my personal learning journey, not commentary on colleagues, employers, or others.

If you find any of the topics here interesting, I'd love to connect with you and learn from your experiences. I find it rewarding to develop quality relationships with people who are passionate about engineering solutions to problems.

## Mission

To share experiences solving engineering problems so that they can be used to coalesce strategies any software engineer can use to solve the problems they are facing.
